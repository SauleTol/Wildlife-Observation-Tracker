# My Wildlife Tracker Analysis Project 🐸

**Objective:** Create a system to track and analyze wildlife observations using SQL.

## What to do 👩‍💻

<ul>
<li><strong> Collect and store animal sightings.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Analyze data to find trends and patterns.</strong></li>
<li><strong> Create charts to visualize the data.</strong><</li>
</ul>

## Work process 🗂️
Firstly, I created a database and then I thought of an optimal structure for it. I decided to have three main tables.The first one represents animals and their characteristics. The second one tracks animal sightings. The third one contains information about locations and their details.

Secondly, I inserted some already generated data into the tables using SQL queries.

Lastly, I did analysis to determine which animals are most frequently seen in different habitats. For example, I found that Koalas are commonly seen in Eucalyptus forests, which is because their main food source is eucalyptus leaves. Additionally, I discovered that most observations occur in Africa, likely due to the Africa's high wildlife diversity.
